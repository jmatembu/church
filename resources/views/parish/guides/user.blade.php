        <h3 class="h2">What is {{ config('app.name') }}</h3>
        <p>{{ config('app.name') }} is a <strong>forever free</strong> service that enables any Catholic Parish grow its online community. As a member, you get to know what's going on in and around your parish.</p>
        <p>As of this writing, using your <strong>{{ config('app.name') }}</strong> account, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>View parish news, events and projects</li>
            <li>Contact the parish directly</li>
            <li>Submit community prayer requests that are visible the public. Community prayer requests allow other members to privately join you in praying for your intentions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are many more features coming up. You can <a href="{{ route('home') }}">read about these upcoming features</a> on the home page. Should you have any idea to share with us, please send us a message using the feedback form which is also available on the home page.</p>
